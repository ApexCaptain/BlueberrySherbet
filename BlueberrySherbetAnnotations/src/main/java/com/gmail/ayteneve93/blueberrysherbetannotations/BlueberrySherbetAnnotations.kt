/**
 * Entry point annotation indicating that target interface is apparently a set of BLE methods service.
 *
 * To configure static BlE methods service, it is necessary to be explicitly declared at the very
 *
 * top of the each interface code before you set any further functions.
 *
 * Example Code
 *
 *      @BlueberryService
 *      interface YourBleService {
 *          fun funcA()
 *          fun funcB()

/**
 * Optional annotation indicating execution priority of BLE function.
 *
 * You can specify execution priority of each BLE function in form of integer.
 *
 * Basically, the lower its value, it'd have higher priority.
 *
 * And the higher priority it has, the sooner it'd be executed.
 *
 * For instance, when you set 2 different BLE functions; 'funcA', 'funcB',
 *
 * and let's say that 'funcA' is much more important than the other one, so it
 *
 * should be executed before 'funcB', then you can declare them as example code below
 *
 * Example Code
 *
 *      @BlueberryService
 *      interface YourBleService {
 *          @Priority(1) // ‚Üê It'll be executed sooner though it's requested lately.
 *          fun funcA()
 *          @Priority(2)
 *          fun funcB()
 *      }
 *
 * If it's not set, the priority of each function would be set as default.
 *
 * @property priority Priority value
